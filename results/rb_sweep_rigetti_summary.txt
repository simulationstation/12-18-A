================================================================================

EXPERIMENT DESIGN
-----------------
Device: Rigetti Ankaa-3 (AWS Braket)
Benchmark: Mirror circuit (U followed by U†)
Depths: [5, 10, 20, 30]
Shots per circuit: 500
Subsets per N: 15

N VALUES TESTED
---------------
N = 9:  15 subsets, C range [2.22, 3.19]
N = 11: 15 subsets, C range [1.63, 3.63]
N = 13: 15 subsets, C range [1.58, 3.81]

CORRELATION RESULTS
-------------------
N=9:   ρ(C, success) = -0.111, p = 0.694  → NO CORRELATION
N=11:  ρ(C, success) = -0.143, p = 0.612  → NO CORRELATION
N=13:  ρ(C, success) = +0.254, p = 0.362  → NO CORRELATION

VARIANCE ANALYSIS
-----------------
N=9:  3.3% of variance explained by C, 96.7% by local noise
N=11: 0.3% of variance explained by C, 99.7% by local noise
N=13: 4.4% of variance explained by C, 95.6% by local noise

PERFORMANCE METRICS
-------------------
N=9:  Mean success = 71.0% ± 16.7%
N=11: Mean success = 63.8% ± 17.5%
N=13: Mean success = 63.8% ± 18.0%

CONCLUSIONS
-----------
1. NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION between architecture metric C = N×λ₂ and
   benchmark success at any subsystem size tested (N = 9, 11, 13).

2. LOCAL QUBIT NOISE DOMINATES: >95% of variance in success probability
   is attributable to subset-specific (local) effects rather than global
   architecture connectivity.

3. NO SIZE-DEPENDENT EMERGENCE: Correlation strength does not systematically
   increase with N. The weak positive trend at N=13 (ρ=+0.25) is not
   statistically significant (p=0.36).

4. IMPLICATIONS: Architecture effects on this device, if present, are below
   the detection threshold of this experimental design. Either:
   - The C metric does not capture the relevant physics
   - Error rates vary too much between individual qubits
   - Deeper circuits or larger N are needed to see the effect
   - The effect does not exist on superconducting hardware

COMBINED WITH N=7 RESULTS
-------------------------
Including the earlier N=7 sweep:
N=7:  ρ = -0.014, p = 0.96 → NO CORRELATION

All four N values (7, 9, 11, 13) show null results.
